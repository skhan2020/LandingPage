This is a Landing page app that has a custom navigation bar that corresponds to the number of sections in the page. There are three sections in the html page in the start and adds 4 more sections dynamically. 


## special

On clicking the navigation links, the page will scroll to the corresponding section and style it so it can be identified as the active section. 


## extra

When the user scrolls the page, the section near the top of the page should automatically get styled as active and its corresponding navigation link should show selected state.
